# Human-Follow-Bot

This bot has been implemented using 1 Ultrasonic Sensor and 2 IR Sensors on either side of the sensor. The ultrasonic sensor detects how far an object/human is and if any of the sensors is triggered, the bot rotates accordingly. If both sensors are triggered then it indicates that the human is present in front of the bot and proceeds to move forward. If the presence of a human is too close to the bot then it moves back accordingly.
